# Tati personal finance :)
my goal is to make a tool to make finance life easy specially for people who live in germany :)

but for now i'm gonna use this readme file as a check list of the project 
### Things that i want to cover:

* Main functionality should work such as:
  * CRUD for transaction with category
  * monthly/yearly Planning
  * show some basic statistics
  * easy to use UI
* batch update
* Import your transactions csv from banks
* Authentication
* Auditing log
* add bank accounts
* statistics

And this is some idea about the future of this project 

* upload picture for adding a transaction(in future it can be done with a mobile app)
* mobile app
* AI finance assistant
